uLocalGov.Starterkit
====================

A local government / public sector themed starter kit
for the Umbraco CMS.

this is a rebooted version of the umbraco.localGov starter kit,
written a few years ago, for v4 of umbraco. 

this version is full of v6 goodness, and is MVC based - and full
of extra learnings 

using the repository
--------------------

This repository represents the site that the starter kit package is built from, 

the code is based on an umbraco 6.1.3 install with the following components installed:

- uComponents
- CropUp
- Config Tree (not really needed but we use)

most of the umbraco files are not in the repository you will need to have an install
of umbraco 6.1.3 already installed before you checkout the code in the repositoy
