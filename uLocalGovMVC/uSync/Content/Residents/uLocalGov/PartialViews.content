  <title>Partial Views</title>
  <bodyText><![CDATA[<p>When functionality is repeated across the site, it can be taken out of templates and moved into Partial Views – these partial views are repeatable chunks of code that can be placed within templates to achieve a specific goal.</p>
<h3>Mega menu</h3>
<p>The MegaMenu partial view (ulgMegaMenuPartial.html) renders the menu across the top of the site. The dropdowns highlight the pages underneath a section and featured items.</p>
<p>The MegaMenu partial, has the following logic.</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.428571429;">Got to the parent section (either a section page or the homepage) for this page</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.428571429;">Enumerate all pages in the section</span></li>
<ol>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.428571429;">Order is determined by the sort order in Umbraco – meaning you can change the order by sorting the content in the Umbraco back end.</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.428571429;">Visible() only returns page that don’t have umbracoNaviHide set or that the user has permission to see</span></li>
</ol>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.428571429;">Create a list from the pages</span></li>
<ol>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.428571429;">For each item, enumerate the top X (default 6) items and put them in the drop down.</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.428571429;">Find the first 3 items which “featured in menu” set and put them in the featured section</span></li>
</ol>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.428571429;">When the menu gets to the pre-defined length (which is set on section) – put all other items in the more drop down.</span></li>
</ol>
<h3>Contact Details</h3>
<p>Throughout the uLocalGov starter kit, contact details have been moved out of content and into a contact us section. This allows for greater control over how users can contact the council, and allows for tracking of contact.</p>
<p>The main partial view for contact is ulgContactLinks. Given a contact node, it renders out the links for telephone, email and address into the side section of a page.</p>
<p>When a user clicks on telephone they are taken to the contact page with the number on it, by handling contact this way, it can be measured from each page.</p>
<h3>News</h3>
<p>The news is a basic set of Partial views to render news on the homepage (ulgHomepageNews) and list news on a news archive (ulNewsList)</p>
<h3>Landing Page Lists</h3>
<p>Landing pages form the back bone of the navigation of the site. a basic landing page consists of a number of ‘straight to…’ links for popular items with the remaining items being placed I the ‘more…’ section</p>
<p>The number of items in the straight to is controlled in the landing page</p>
<p>Links are rendered in their Umbraco sort order – changing the order of nodes inside Umbraco changes this order</p>
<p>The “Straight To” and ”More…” text is set in dictionary items. Allowing you to change it once throughout the site (and have it in welsh)</p>]]></bodyText>
