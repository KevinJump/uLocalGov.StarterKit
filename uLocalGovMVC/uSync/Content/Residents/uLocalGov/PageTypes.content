  <title>Page Types (DocumentTypes)</title>
  <bodyText><![CDATA[<p>Each type of page within the starter kit is defined as a Document type – each Document Type defines what content fields make up a page, what page templates are used to render it and what the structure can be (what document types are allowed as children of each type).</p>
<h3>Service Alerts</h3>
<p>In the starter kit service alerts are a special document type as they do not render as a page, but rather are used as snippets of content that is placed on other pages to form an alert.</p>
<p>Alerts are created in the Shared Content section of the site. then a content editor goes to the area of the site they want the alert to appear and pick the service alert (Page Info/Service Alerts). The alert is rendered across the top of the page.</p>
<p>Service alerts can be put on any page of the site, and are especially useful when something has disrupted the service for some reason.</p>
<h3>Sections</h3>
<p>The uLocalgov starter kit splits the site into sections, the main ones being Resident, Business and Council. These sections allow for content to be segmented based on the user type.</p>
<p>Each section has its own homepage, megamenu and style, the homepage is controlled via the page template, the style is set in the section content node, and the menu is constructed based on the child nodes of each section.</p>
<h3>Landing Pages</h3>
<p>Landing pages form the back bone of the site navigation, the landing page type has a title, and content and a setting to define how many items appear in the “Straight to” section of the page.</p>
<h3>Standard Content</h3>
<p>The majority of pages within the site are standard content pages. these pages have navigation, related items, contact details built in, the page content is then rendered in the centre of the page.</p>
<h3>Contact Pages</h3>
<p>All contact on the site is centralized into the contact pages, this allows for easy management and measurement of contact. For the starter kit the forms are not functional. You would place your own favourite form software in the gap.</p>]]></bodyText>
